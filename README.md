# Cypress API Automation Example
Welcome to the Study Smarter API Automation project! We leverage the power of Cypress to perform end-to-end API testing for the Study Smarter website, a comprehensive online learning platform. By utilizing Cypress, we ensure the seamless functioning and reliability of our API endpoints.

### Dependencies
To get started with this project, make sure to install the necessary dependencies. Simply run the following command to download them:
```
npm i
```

### Running Tests
We offer two options for executing the API tests based on your preference and requirements:

#### Headed Execution (with UI)
To run the tests in the headed mode with the Cypress Test Runner, execute the following command:
```
npm run cy:open
```

#### Headless Execution
For a faster and more automated execution, you can run the tests in headless mode. Execute the following command:
```
npm run cy:run
```

This will initiate the headless execution of the tests, providing results without the need for user interface interaction.

Feel free to explore and enhance the API automation tests using Cypress for the Study Smarter project. Happy testing!
